# Sonic.API

## wut
The backend for Sonic - the unethical consumption database.

## dependencies
This is a [BeeAPI](https://github.com/HauntedBees/BeeAPI) Module, so you should place the contents of this repository in a "Sonic" folder at the root of a BeeAPI directory. If you already have BeeAPI, you can also run `git submodule add https://github.com/HauntedBees/Sonic.API Sonic` there. The [Gregwar Captcha](https://github.com/Gregwar/Captcha) library is also used, and making that be a composer dependency instead of just a chunk of code copied and pasted into this repo is on the TODO list.

## license
